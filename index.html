            <h2>Hello.</h2>
            <p class="intro">I am a year 8 at Newlands Intermediate School. I'm 11 years old, and I really like sport
                and anime.
                Personally, I think one of my best subjects in school is english. I spend a lot of time reading, and
                sometimes I even write books. Currently, I am learning Web Development and I'm excited to learn how to
                style a website well. I live in New Zealand, Wellington and I really like it here. I hope to be
                something in the medical department when I grow older. My favourite author right now is Lauren Oliver. I
                really admire her work, and the way she writes. My favourite book of hers is 'Before I fall' which has
                even been made into a movie. I have a younger sister, which is currently 15 months (1 year and 3 months)
                and an elder brother, which is currently 18 years old. I really admire my brother, Mazen Khallaf, as he
                got second in his whole school, got scholarships for many universities, and is a very successful person.
                I hope to be like him someday.

                <h3>Netball</h3>
                <p>I started Netball when I was 8 years old. At first, I sucked at it, but with time I got better. In
                    year 6 (when I was ten years old) I got into A grade for my school team. I enjoy Netball a lot.</p>

                <h3>Volleyball</h3>
                <p>When I first got into volleyball, it was from just passing with my friends. After a while, I wanted
                    to go further, and play competitively. I'm planning to continue to play volleyball for the school
                    team in the upcoming years. </p>

                <h3>Chess</h3>
                <p>At the start of year 7 (2022), My teacher set up a tournament for anyone who wanted to join chess.
                    Because I knew how to play, I decided to join in. When I lost in round 2, I decided I wanted to get
                    better. I watched videos on chess openings, made friends who were good at chess, and got a lot
                    better. Now I'm decent at it, and I really enjoy playing it. </p>

                <h3>Martial Arts</h3>
                <p>When I was about 7 years old, I started Karate. I did it for about 2 years until I quit. After
                    another 2 years I joined back again. I am currently in 7th kyu. I also went to a karate tournament
                    in Napier, and got gold.</p>

                <h3>Writing</h3>
                <p>I started writing novels at 9 years old. I used <a href="https://nanowrimo.org/">
                        Nanowrimo</a> which encouraged me to do it more. I was inspired to write by some of my favorite
                    authors such as 'Tracy Wolff', 'Lauren Oliver', 'Coleen Hoover', 'Kristin Kashore' and 'Elly Blake'.
                    I wanted to make people laugh and cry when they read my books too, so I decided I would write. I
                    hope to be an author along with a docter when I am older.</p>

                <h3>Web Development</h3>
                <p>Currently, I am learning Web Development with Angela Yu. I am taking The Complete 2023 Web
                    Development Bootcamp from Udemy. I am mostly doing it for the design because I really like designing
                    things, but I also would like to be good at programming.</p>
